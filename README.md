CSC 207 MP3: Text Layout
September 22, 2023

In this project, I create numerous classes that implement the TextBlock class. I also create methods to test the equivilance of these boxes.

Acknowledgements: Che for being an amazing friend :D He helped me with figuring out how to loop through characters in the horizontally flipped class. And thank you Sam for answering questions on how truncated, centered, and right-justified should look, as well as offering useful hints in the MP page.
